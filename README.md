Javazone video mashup site
==========================

Repo for a mashup site for the javazone videos. Our aim is to give some
value-add to the videos themselves with info from the program, speaker bios, 
links to other resources on the same topic, easy sharing of videos, rss feeds and more.

For the techno-heads
----------------------
* Play! framework
* MongoDB+Morphia

Deployed to javazone-videos.herokuapp.com now and then.
