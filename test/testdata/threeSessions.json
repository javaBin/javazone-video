To make the transition a little bit easier it might help to keep some of the existing Java frameworks your company have experience in using.

In general, it's safe to say that NoSQL is a contender against traditional RDBMSs if data storage and retrieval needs aren't transactional.  This presentation covers three case studies where traditional RDBMS approaches had been taken, and ultimately abandoned in favor of NoSQL document databases and massive, fast-access storage mechanisms.  The presentation covers Java, mongoDB, HBase, GridFS, and HDFS, and provides insights into how each of of the applications were designed, deployed, refactored, and launched in production.\n</div>\n</div>\n"},{"id":"a044731e-3c9a-4106-91e3-fd7512369483","format":"Presentation","level":{"id":"Introductory","displayName":"Introductory","iconUrl":"http://javazone.no/incogito10/rest/events/JavaZone%202011/icons/levels/Introductory.png"},"end":{"month":9,"year":2011,"valid":true,"day":7,"eonAndYear":2011,"fractionalSecond":null,"hour":18,"minute":0,"second":0,"timezone":-2147483648,"xmlschemaType":{"prefix":"","namespaceURI":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema","localPart":"dateTime"},"eon":null,"millisecond":-2147483648},"labels":[{"id":"methodology","displayName":"Methodology","iconUrl":"http://javazone.no/incogito10/rest/events/JavaZone%202011/icons/labels/methodology.png"},{"id":"enterprise-java","displayName":"Enterprise Java","iconUrl":"http://javazone.no/incogito10/rest/events/JavaZone%202011/icons/labels/enterprise-java.png"},{"id":"concurrency-and-scalability","displayName":"Concurrency & scalability","iconUrl":"http://javazone.no/incogito10/rest/events/JavaZone%202011/icons/labels/concurrency-and-scalability.png"},{"id":"programming-concepts","displayName":"Programming concepts","iconUrl":"http://javazone.no/incogito10/rest/events/JavaZone%202011/icons/labels/programming-concepts.png"}],"start":{"month":9,"year":2011,"valid":true,"day":7,"eonAndYear":2011,"fractionalSecond":null,"hour":17,"minute":0,"second":0,"timezone":-2147483648,"xmlschemaType":{"prefix":"","namespaceURI":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema","localPart":"dateTime"},"eon":null,"millisecond":-2147483648},"room":"Sal 2","title":"A Deep Dive into Spring's IoC Support, in 2011, and in the Future","speakers":[{"name":"Josh Long","bioHtml":"<div class=\"wiki\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nJosh Long is the Spring developer advocate for SpringSource, an editor on the Java queue for InfoQ.com, and the lead author on several books, including Apress' \"Pro Spring Integration,\" and \"Spring Recipes, 2nd Edition\" Josh has spoken at many different industry conferences internationally including TheServerSide Java Symposium, SpringOne, Geecon, OSCON, JavaZone, Devoxx, Java2Days, SpringOne2GX, DreamForce, numerous Java User Groups worldwide, and many more.
